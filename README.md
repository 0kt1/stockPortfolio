# Stock Market App

This is a stock market app that allows users to search for stocks and view their current price, change, and chart. 

###Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies.


###Features

The app has the following features:

* Search for stocks by symbol
* View the current price, change, and chart for a stock
* View the last updated time and the closing time of the stock market

###Code Explanation

The code for the app is divided into three files:

* `index.html` - This file contains the HTML code for the app.
* `main.css` - This file contains the CSS code for the app.
* `main.js` - This file contains the JavaScript code for the app.

The `index.html` file contains the basic HTML code for the app. It includes the header, body, and footer sections. The header section contains the title of the app and a link to the main CSS file. The body section contains the main content of the app, which includes the search bar, the stock information, and the chart. The footer section contains the last updated time and the closing time of the stock market.

The `main.css` file contains the CSS code for the app. It styles the different elements of the app, such as the header, body, and footer. It also styles the search bar, the stock information, and the chart.

The `main.js` file contains the JavaScript code for the app. It handles the following:

* Getting the stock information from the API
* Updating the stock information on the page
* Creating the stock chart

The `main.js` file starts by importing the necessary libraries. It then defines the following functions:

* `getStockInfo()` - This function gets the stock information from the API.
* `getIndices()` - This function gets the indices information from the API.
* `getStockChart()` - This function creates the stock chart.
* `formatDate()` - This function formats the date.
